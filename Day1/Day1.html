        What is Virtual DOM?
    </h1>
    <p>In React virtual DOM is replica of a real DOM but it cannot directly manipulate the DOM content</p>
    <p>React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM). So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen. So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM. </p>

        <h1>What are Single Page Applications?</h1>
        <p> Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that does not use the default method of loading new pages completely. Instead, it takes new data from the webserver by interacting with the web browser and refreshes the current web page.

            React is great for single page applications because it allows developers to create applications that are mobile first and responsive. React allows developers to create applications that are fast and easy to update, which is great for mobile applications.

        <h1>What do you mean by state and its use in react?</h1>
        <p>The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component</p>

        <h1>What is JSX and why do we use it instead of JS?</h1>
        <p>
            JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
            It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript. Instead of separating the markup and logic in separated files, React uses components for this purpose. We will learn about components in detail in further articles.

        <h1>What is Package.json?</h1>
        <p>The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. All npm packages contain a file, usually in the project root, called package. json - this file holds various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies.
